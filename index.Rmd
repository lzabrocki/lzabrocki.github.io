# About Me
I am currently a PhD student at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and a teaching fellow at the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en). My PhD supervisor is [Hélène Ollivier](https://sites.google.com/site/heleneollivier/) (CNRS-PSE). 

<span style="color:#0471a6">**I am currently on the job market.**</span>

My thesis focuses on improving causal inference methods to better measure the effects of air pollution on health. I am particularly interested in matching procedures and randomization-based inference. I enjoy programming in R and I am always looking for new ways to improve my data visualization skills.

In my job market paper with [Vincent Bagilet](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/) (PhD student, Columbia University), we explore how several causal inference methods perform to estimate the effects of air pollution on short-term mortality and morbidity. Specifically, we use simulations to understand why research designs could be under-powered and thereby produce inflated estimates. We propose simple recommendations to take into account statistical power issues.
