Yet, statistical power calculations are rarely—if ever—carried out. We first collect estimates and standard errors of all available articles found in the standard epidemiology and causal inference literatures. We find that nearly half of them may suffer from a low statistical power and could thereby produce statistically significant estimates that are actually inflated. We then run simulations based on real data to identify which parameters of research designs affect statistical power. Despite their large sample sizes, we show that studies exploiting rare exogenous shocks such as transport strikes or thermal inversions could have a very low statistical power, even for plausibly large effect sizes. Our simulation results indicate that the observed discrepancy in the literature between instrumental variable estimates and non-causal ones could be partly explained by the inherent imprecision of the two-stage least-squares estimator. We also provide evidence that subgroup analysis on the elderly or children should be implemented with caution since the average number of events for an health outcome is a major driver of power. Based on these findings, we build a series of recommendations for researchers to evaluate the design of their study with respect to statistical power issues.\r\nEstimating the Causal Effects of Cruise Traffic on Air Pollution using Randomization-Based Inference\r\nwith Marion Leroutier (Misum, Stockholm School of Economics) & Marie-Abèle Bind (Massachusetts General Hospital), Working Paper submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal environmental organizations and media have recently expressed concerns over air pollution induced by maritime traffic and its potential adverse health effects on the population of Mediterranean port cities. We explore this issue with unique high-frequency data from Marseille, France’s largest port for cruise ships, over the 2008-2018 period. Using a new pair-matching algorithm designed for time series data, we create hypothetical randomized experiments and estimate the variation in air pollutant concentrations caused by a short-term increase in cruise vessel traffic. We carry out a randomization-based approach to compute 95% Fisherian intervals (FI) for constant treatment effects consistent with the matched data and the hypothetical intervention. At the hourly level, cruise vessels’ arrivals increase concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO\\(_{2}\\)) by 4.7 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% FI: [1.4, 8.0]), of sulfur dioxide (SO\\(_{2}\\)) by 1.2 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% FI: [-0.1, 2.5]), and of particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) by 4.6 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% FI: [0.9, 8.3]). At the daily level, cruise traffic increases concentrations of NO\\(_{2}\\) by 1.2 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% FI: [-0.5, 3.0]) and of PM\\(_{10}\\) by 1.3 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% FI: [-0.3, 3.0]). Our results suggest that well-designed hypothetical randomized experiments provide a principled approach to better understand the negative externalities of maritime traffic.\r\nArxiv Preprint, OSF Preprint, Replication Materials.\r\nMeasuring the Influence of Wind on Air Pollution Using a Causal Inference Pipeline\r\nwith Anna Alari (ISGlobal) and Tarik Benmarhnia (UC San Diego), Working Paper submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges in wind patterns can substantially alter the air pollution level of a city. It is however not straightforward to statistically estimate this relationship. Since wind variations are not randomly distributed over time and are related to other weather parameters influencing air pollution, researchers must adjust for these confounding factors. As an alternative to current practices, we implement a causal inference pipeline to embed an observational study within an hypothetical randomized experiment. We illustrate this new approach for air pollution studies using 4018 daily observations from Paris, France, over the 2008-2018 period. Following the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework, we first define our treatment of interest as the effects on several air pollutant concentrations of North-East winds (824 units) compared to other wind directions (3194 units). We then use a matching algorithm to approximate a pair randomized experiment resulting only in 119 matched pairs. By pruning many units, matching allows us to adjust nonparametrically for observed confounders while avoiding model extrapolation to treated days without similar control days. Once the balance of treated and control groups was deemed satisfactory, we estimate the average differences in air pollutant concentrations and their sampling variability using Neymanian inference. We find that North-East winds increase PM\\(_{10}\\) concentrations by 4.8 µg/m\\(^3\\) (95% CI: 2.6, 6.9). As in any observational studies, an unobserved confounder could bias our results. We therefore carry out a sensitivity analysis which reveals that an unobserved variable 2 times more common among treated units could make our data compatible with small negative effects up to very large effects (95% CI: -0.5, 10.6). Our causal inference approach should make researchers aware that finding the subset of similar observations to estimate more credibly the effects of wind patterns on air pollution may be more difficult than previously thought.\r\nThe importance of implementing a design stage in environmental epidemiology\r\nwith Tarik Benmarhnia and Marie-Abele Bind, New version available in November 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of causal inference methods has recently increased in the epidemiological literature, these approaches are still underused in environmental epidemiology. In this paper, we review traditional and modern matching algorithms available to environmental epidemiologists and we illustrate the benefit of balancing covariates using a motivating example that, we hope, should resonate to environmental epidemiologists. We first introduce the potential outcomes framework and the standard, necessary assumptions about the assumed assignment mechanism to address causality. Using a real environmental data set, we conducted a simulation study of the effect of heat waves on daily number of years of life lost (YoLL). More specifically, we simulated the daily potential outcomes had the heat wave occurred. The true effect of heat wave was set to 230 daily YoLL. We analyzed the simulated data using traditional multivariable regression methods and using propensity score matching, which led to a matched dataset with 210 pairs of days (with and without heat wave) similar with respect to the previous lags of daily temperature, NO2, ozone, humidity, and calendar variables. Using traditional regression approaches, heat waves were associated with 339 daily YoLL [95%CI: 321; 357]. Using the PSM approach, the estimated causal effect of heat waves on YoLL was 220 YoLL [95%CI: 155; 285]. We discuss the benefit of balancing pre-exposure covariates before estimating the health impacts of environmental factors and discuss advantages and limitations of balancing methods.\r\nWork in Progess\r\nBelow is a list of works for which drafts will be available in early 2022.\r\nThe Trade-Off Between Omitted Variable Bias and Type M Error\r\nwith Vincent Bagilet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, we illustrate with simple fake-data simulations why the trade-off between omitted variable bias and Type M error should be more systematically into account. In some contexts, the omitted variable bias can be relatively small. If we overcome this bias by exploiting an under-powered causal inference method, we can run a type M error that could be potentially larger than the omitted variable bias. To take into account this trade-off, we recommend to (i) carry out retropower calculations to better assess the statistical power of our studies against a range of plausible effect sizes and (ii) implement quantitative bias analysis to check to which extent unobserved confounders could bias our results.\r\nImproving Instrumental Variables Design to Better Estimate the Acute Health Effects of Air Pollution\r\nwith Tarik Benmarhnia.\r\nInstrumental variable designs have been increasingly used to estimate the short-term effects of air pollutants on mortality and morbidity. Using the data of several flagship publications, we will show (i) how to improve observed covariates balances and avoid model extrapolation using several matching algorithms (and especially near-far matching which is specifically designed for IVs), (ii) how to carry out a quantitative bias analysis to both a naive and an IV strategy suffer from omitted variable bias and (iii) use simulations to understand when the correlation among air pollutants can be really an issue for the exclusion restriction.\r\nThe Effects of Air Pollution Exposure during Pregnancy on Children’s Health\r\nwith Marion Davin & Emmanuelle Lavaine (University of Montpellier).\r\nMothers exposed to high air pollution are often very different from the ones living in low air pollution areas. The resulting lack in observed covariates makes it difficult to estimate credibly the effect of air pollution exposure during pregnancy on birth weight and later child’s outcomes. Using data on 18,000 children from the French ELFE cohort, we implement a cardinality matching procedure to find similar pairs of mothers exposed to high and low levels of ambient air pollutants (Giancarlo Visconti and José R. Zubizarreta, Observational Studies, 2018). We then rely on randomization-inference to estimate the range of treatment effects consistent with the data and finally carry out a sensitivity analysis to test if unobserved confounders could alter the results.\r\nOther Works\r\nBelow is the list of works for which I was not the principal investigator.\r\nThe effects of an air quality alert program on premature mortality: A difference-in-differences evaluation in the region of Paris\r\nAnna Alari, Lara Schwarz, Léo Zabrocki, Géraldine Le Nir, Basile Chaix, Tarik Benmarhnia, International Environment (2021). Remark: I carefully read the paper and provided comments.\r\nBackground: Daily exposure to air pollution has been shown to increase cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. While increases in short-term exposure to air pollutants at any daily concentrations has been shown to be associated to adverse health outcomes, days with extreme levels, also known as air pollution peaks based on specific thresholds, have been used to implement air quality alerts in various cities across the globe. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating the potential effects of the Air Quality Alerts (AQA) system on different causes of premature mortality in Paris, France.\r\nMethods: Air quality alerts (AQA) based on particulate matter (PM10) levels and related interventions were implemented in the region of Paris in 2008 and were revised to be more stringent in 2011. In this study, we applied a difference-in-differences (DID) approach coupled with propensity-score matching (PSM) to daily mortality data for the period 2000 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of the Paris AQA program on different causes of premature mortality for the entire population and for adults > 75 years old.\r\nResults: Overall, results did not show evidence of a reduction in mortality of the PM10 AQA program when first implemented in 2008 with initial thresholds (80 \\(\\mu g/m^3\\)); DID estimates were slightly above 1 for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. However, when evaluating the drastic reduction in revised thresholds in 2011 (50 \\(\\mu g/m^3\\)) to trigger interventions, we identified a reduction in cardiovascular (DID = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.755 to 0.930) mortality, but no change in respiratory mortality was detected (DID = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.796, 1.191).\r\nDiscussion: Our study suggests that AQA may not have health benefits for the population when thresholds are set at high daily PM10 levels. Given that such policies are implemented in many other metropolitan areas across the globe, evaluating the effectiveness of AQA is important to provide public authorities and researchers a rationale for defining specific thresholds and extending the scope of these policies to lower air pollution levels.\r\nIndividual and Environmental Risk Factors for COVID-19 Mortality in Elderly\r\nThomas Bourdrel, Leo Zabrocki, Nathalie Compte, Romain Descours, Hélène Pelerin, Laure De Decker, Laurence Le Jumeau de Kergaradec, Mathieu Lilamand, Claire Roubaud Baudron, Bertrand Fougères, Rachid Mahmoudi, Benoit Schorr, Georges Kaltenbach and Thomas Vogel, Submitted. Remark: I was in charge of the statistical analysis.The replication can be found at this link.\r\nSeveral studies have already explored individual and environmental risk factors for COVID- 19 morality, however most study populations consisted of the overall population and mainly from China or the US. Our study focused on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly in seven European cities. Long-term exposure to air pollution was estimated through annual pollutant concentrations at the residential address averaged over the last two years of the study period between February and May 2020. We focused on the main outdoor air pollutants PM\\(_{10}\\), PM\\(_{2.5}\\), NO\\(_{2}\\) and O\\(_{3}\\). Short-term variations in air pollutants and weather parameters (e.g., temperature, UV, relative humidity) were also examined through a 20-day period before the confirmed PCR diagnostic of COVID-19. Individual risk factors such as smoking status, sex, body mass index (BMI), ischemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, history of cancer, COPD, and lung fibrosis, were taken into account. We found positive associations for diabetes and COVID-19 mortality (OR 2.2 CI 95% :1.1, 4.4). Using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for all patient characteristics and city, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no association between COVID-19 mortality and long-term and short-term increase in PM\\(_{2.5}\\), PM\\(_{10}\\), NO\\(_{2}\\) and O\\(_{3}\\). Our study suffers from the fact that patient profiles strongly differ between high-polluted and less-polluted cities. Strong differences in COVID- 19 mortalities were observed between cities, which could be due to differences in COVID-19 management and treatment, such as accessibility to reanimation and intensive units between cities. Overall, our study highlights the need to improve estimation of individual exposure to air pollution. Indeed, even with the high-efficiency modelisation systems used in our study, we were unable to estimate the effect of air pollution within each city, because variations in air pollution exposure were too small. Individual markers of air pollution exposure such as recently demonstrated with urinary black carbon or passive individual samplers, would be most suitable for future explorations. Concerning weather parameters, although previous studies concluded that increase in temperature and UV index could decrease COVID-19 morality, our data did not allow us to reject the null hypotheses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Has an advertisement campaign increased consumer loyalty? Does a new vaccine protect from a virus ? In this year-long course, you will understand why randomized controlled trials are considered as the most rigorous method for answering the previous questions. You will learn the theoretical foundation, the statistical techniques, and programming skills to analyze randomized experiments. The course draws on a variety of concrete examples to make the materials as intuitive as possible. Priority is given to the implementation of concepts in the R programming language over mathematical formulas. By the end of the academic year, you will be able to critically evaluate and reproduce results from published articles.\r\nIn the first semester, you will be introduced to the Neyman-Rubin causal model, a simple yet powerful framework for thinking about causality. The sessions will cover the design of several types of treatment allocation (i.e., complete, cluster, block and pair designs) and randomization-based inference techniques, which provide an intuitive introduction to statistical inference. We will also learn the repeated sampling approach developed by Neyman. Issues related the adoption of treatment by treated and control units (i.e., one-sided and two-sided noncompliance problems) will . All concepts will be illustrated with concrete examples drawn from results of randomized experiments published in various disciplines such as Economics, Political Science, Psychology or Medicine.\r\nIn the second semester, the sessions will be devoted to the replication of a published randomized experiment. In the first five classes, you will develop new skills in data wrangling, visualization, and project management workflow. You will learn how to make your analysis fully reproducible by an external person. The rest of the courses will guide you towards the replication of an experiment that you will have chosen. You will also be required to test the robustness of the results found by researchers.\r\nThe course follows closely the textbook Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation written by Gerber and Green (2012), with additional inputs from three other textbooks (Imbens and Rubin 2015, Rosenbaum 2010 & 2017). I have drafted detailed notes which summarize all key points. These notes must be read before the lectures to take full advantage of them.
